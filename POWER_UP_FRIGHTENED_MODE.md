# 🎯 Power-Up Based Frightened Mode - Implementation Complete

## ✅ **Successfully Implemented Features**

### 🔋 **Power-Up Activation System**
- **Trigger**: Eating Power-Ups (yellow circles, 'o' in level layout) activates Frightened mode
- **Points**: Power-Ups now give 50 points when eaten
- **Detection**: `justAtePowerUp()` method detects power-up consumption
- **Global Effect**: All ghosts enter Frightened mode for 10 seconds

### 👻 **Frightened Ghost Behavior**
- **Visual**: Ghosts show **only eyes** (no body) in Frightened mode
- **Movement**: Random movement using improved `randomTile()` method
- **Speed**: 50% slower movement (0.5x normal speed)
- **Duration**: 10 seconds with automatic timer management

### 🎯 **Ghost Eating Mechanics**
- **Edible State**: Only frightened ghosts (showing eyes) can be eaten
- **Progressive Scoring**: 200 → 400 → 800 → 1600 points per ghost sequence
- **Counter Reset**: Score progression resets each new frightened phase
- **Instant Respawn**: Eaten ghosts teleport directly to spawn center

### 🔄 **Ghost Recovery System**
- **No EATEN State**: Ghosts skip the "return to base" animation
- **Instant Teleport**: Eaten ghosts immediately appear at spawn position (center)
- **Restart in Scatter**: Ghosts begin 7-second Scatter mode after being eaten
- **Normal Cycle**: Resume standard IN_BASE → SCATTER → CHASE → SCATTER cycle

### ⏰ **State Management**
- **Automatic Timer**: Frightened mode ends after 10 seconds
- **Speed Restoration**: Normal movement speed restored after frightened mode
- **State Transitions**: Clean transitions between all ghost states
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear distinction between normal, frightened, and eaten states

## 🎮 **Updated Gameplay Flow**

1. **Normal Gameplay**: Ghosts chase Pac-Man with individual AI patterns
2. **Power-Up Collection**: Pac-Man eats Power-Up (+50 points)
3. **Frightened Activation**: All ghosts show only eyes and move randomly/slowly
4. **Ghost Hunting Phase**: Pac-Man can eat eye-only ghosts for bonus points
5. **Instant Respawn**: Eaten ghosts teleport to center and restart in Scatter mode
6. **Timer Expiration**: After 10 seconds, remaining ghosts return to normal behavior

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Changes Made:**
- **Map.cpp**: Added `hasPowerUp()` method and 50-point scoring for power-ups
- **PacMan.cpp**: Added `justAtePowerUp()` detection with `powerUpEaten` flag
- **Ghostbase.cpp**: Modified `draw()` to show only eyes in frightened mode
- **Ghostbase.cpp**: Changed `getEaten()` to teleport instead of EATEN state
- **Game.cpp**: Switched from fruit-based to power-up-based frightened activation

### **Visual System:**
```cpp
// Normal ghosts: Full body + eyes
// Frightened ghosts: Only large eyes (no body)
// Eaten ghosts: Instant teleport to spawn
```

### **State Transitions:**
```
Normal: IN_BASE → SCATTER → CHASE → SCATTER → CHASE...
Power-Up Eaten: ANY_STATE → FRIGHTENED (10s) → CHASE
Ghost Eaten: FRIGHTENED → SCATTER (teleported to spawn)
```

## 🎯 **Game Balance**

- **Power-Up Locations**: 4 power-ups on map (corners)
- **Frightened Duration**: 10 seconds - enough for strategic play
- **Ghost Speed**: 50% reduction makes them catchable but not trivial  
- **Scoring Progression**: Escalating rewards encourage eating multiple ghosts
- **Instant Respawn**: Maintains game pace without long return animations

## 🎮 **Player Experience**

### **Controls & Instructions:**
- Arrow Keys/WASD: Move Pac-Man
- Collect all coins (10 pts each)
- Fruits give 100 points
- **Power-ups (yellow) make ghosts vulnerable!**
- Eat frightened ghosts (eyes only) for bonus points
- Avoid normal ghosts or game over

The Power-Up based Frightened mode system is now fully functional and provides the classic Pac-Man power-up experience where eating the special yellow power-ups creates exciting reversal opportunities! 🎉
