# Frightened Mode Implementation - Complete

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. **Fruit Detection & Frightened Mode Activation**
- When Pac-Man eats a fruit, all ghosts enter Frightened mode for 10 seconds
- Implemented in `PacMan::update()` with `justAteFruit()` flag system
- Game class detects fruit consumption and triggers frightened state

### 2. **Frightened Ghost Behavior**
- **Visual Changes**: Ghosts turn blue in frightened mode, dark gray when eaten
- **Movement Changes**: 
  - 50% slower movement speed (0.5x normal speed)
  - Random movement pattern using improved `randomTile()` method
  - Avoids predictable chase patterns

### 3. **Ghost Eating Mechanics**
- Pac-Man can eat frightened ghosts for bonus points
- **Progressive Scoring**: 200, 400, 800, 1600 points per ghost in sequence
- Score resets when new frightened phase begins

### 4. **Eaten Ghost Recovery**
- Eaten ghosts enter EATEN state with visual changes (only eyes visible)
- Return to base at **double speed** (2x normal)
- Restart in Scatter mode after reaching spawn position
- Cannot be eaten again while in EATEN state

### 5. **Automatic State Management**
- **Frightened Timer**: 10 seconds duration
- **Auto-Recovery**: Ghosts return to Chase mode when timer expires
- **Speed Restoration**: Normal movement speed restored after frightened mode
- **State Priority**: EATEN state overrides other states until recovery

### 6. **Enhanced Game Features**
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear color coding (Blue = Frightened, Dark Gray = Eaten)
- **Improved Instructions**: Updated How-to-Play with frightened mode rules
- **Score Tracking**: Ghost eaten counter properly managed per frightened phase

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Flow

1. **Normal Play**: Ghosts chase Pac-Man using individual AI patterns
2. **Fruit Spawning**: Random fruit appears on coin positions
3. **Fruit Consumption**: Pac-Man eats fruit (+100 points)
4. **Frightened Activation**: All living ghosts become blue and slow
5. **Ghost Hunting**: Pac-Man can now eat blue ghosts for bonus points
6. **Ghost Recovery**: Eaten ghosts return to base and resume normal behavior
7. **Timer Expiration**: After 10 seconds, remaining frightened ghosts return to chase mode

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Key Classes Modified:
- **`PacMan`**: Added fruit detection with `justAteFruit()` method
- **`Ghostbase`**: Enhanced with frightened state management and timers
- **`Game`**: Integrated fruit detection with global ghost state management
- **`Map`**: Added `hasFruit()` method for better fruit detection

### State Transitions:
```
Normal: IN_BASE â†’ SCATTER â†’ CHASE â†’ SCATTER â†’ CHASE...
With Fruit: CHASE â†’ FRIGHTENED (10s) â†’ CHASE
When Eaten: FRIGHTENED â†’ EATEN â†’ (return to base) â†’ SCATTER
```

### Performance Features:
- **Discrete Movement**: Tile-based movement system maintains game feel
- **Efficient Collision**: Optimized ghost-pacman collision detection
- **State Timers**: Proper timing system for all ghost states

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Balance

- **Frightened Duration**: 10 seconds provides good risk/reward balance
- **Ghost Speed**: 50% reduction makes ghosts catchable but not trivial
- **Scoring System**: Progressive ghost values encourage strategic play
- **Recovery Speed**: 2x speed ensures eaten ghosts return quickly

The Frightened mode system is now fully functional and provides the classic Pac-Man experience where eating fruit creates exciting reversal opportunities!
